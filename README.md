# ArpOn
Plaits: Macro oscillator, with arpeggios

Acts like a normal plaits, but the way you access settings has changed...

## When in normal model/engine select mode
* holding down the left button will take you into the settings.
* holding down the right button resets the arp to the first note.

## Settings 

* press the left button to move through the settings.
* press the right button to exit the settings.

**Green led shows which setting, red led shows current values**
* 1st - plaits lpg colour and decay settings (same as plaits)
* 2nd - plaits octave setting (same as plaits)
* 3rd - arpeggio steps (0 for normal plaits, 1 to 8 for arpeggios, 9 for nothing yet)
* 4th - arpeggios mode (up, down, inclusive, exclusive, random, random walk, random walk with pause)
* 5th - arpeggio selector (shows the current arp in binary on the leds)
